## Fieldwork
- **EDM³ Lab, York University (2024–2025)** — Designed cryogenic detection and optical/magnetic alignment pipelines for **eEDM** in matrix-isolated **BaF**; stabilized UHV/cryo conditions to extend spin coherence and polarization fidelity; built custom simulations to refine sensitivity to subtle shifts.
- **Goethe University — GREP Fellow (2024)** — Simulated **quantum-gravity corrections** to **black-hole shadows**; integrated Event Horizon Telescope datasets to tighten model agreement; presented results internationally.
- **University of Alberta (2023–2024)** — Theoretical quantum gravity across LQG and string-inspired frameworks; cross-institutional consistency checks and simulation validation.
- **IBM Quantum (2023)** — Implemented **dynamic decoupling** for error mitigation; ran a **Stern–Gerlach** experiment on real devices with Qiskit; presented outcomes at York’s SURC.

## Community
Undergraduate Chair, **Canadian Association of Physicists — SAC**; led national programming and an IAPS partnership; service on CAP Medal & UN IYQ task groups; President, **PSYU** (Physics Student Association at York).
